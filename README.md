### Comments in JavaScript
- Any text between a `//` and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript
- Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment. This may span multiple lines.

The following examples shows how to use comments in JavaScript.
```
// This is a comment. 
console.log("This statement will be executed");
/*
* And this is a multiline comment in JavaScript
*/
```

The **script** tag allows you to store JavaScript in an external file and then include it into your HTML files.

   </head>
   
   <body>
      .......
   </body>
</html>
